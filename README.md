The above projects have been done extensively using GraphLab Create machine learning framework. Inorder to run these in your personal systems, please go to https://dato.com/products/create/ and register yourself for a free trial. After downloading Graphlab Create, 
start the ipython notebook terminal by clicking Dato Launcher from your desktop.


Learning Outcomes:  
   -Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.  
   -Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.
   -Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  
   -Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.
   -Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. 
   -Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.
   -Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.
   -Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  
   -Implement these techniques in Python.
